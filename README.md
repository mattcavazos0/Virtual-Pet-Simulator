# Virtual-Pet-Simulator

### Overview
This is a simple, strategy-based simulation that allows a user to tend to a virtual "pet."
The goal of this game is to keep your pet alive for as long as possible.
To keep the pet alive, the user must tend to its 'needs' (i.e. hunger, boredom and fatigue).
The need levels increase with every new day, and the user can choose only one of the needs to tend to daily.

### Prerequisites
This program is written in Python 3.0 and run in a command line interface.

### Implementation
This game opens a graphic window that displays the pet's information and status.
The game uses a graphics library that was created from tkinter. 
A copy of this library is attached and labelled "graphics.py".
